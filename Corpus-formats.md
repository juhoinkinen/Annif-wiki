Annif uses different kinds of subject and document corpora.

- **Subject vocabulary corpora** define the set of possible subjects (concepts) that can be assigned to documents. These are typically SKOS or TSV files.
- **Document corpora** are collections of documents (with or without assigned subjects) used for training, evaluation, or testing.

See:
* [[Subject vocabulary formats]] for supported vocabulary formats
* [[Document corpus formats]] for supported document/training formats
