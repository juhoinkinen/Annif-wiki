Annif uses different kinds of subject and document corpora.

- **Subject vocabulary corpora** define the set of possible subjects (concepts) that can be assigned to documents. These are typically SKOS or TSV files. See [[Subject vocabulary formats]].
- **Document corpora** are collections of documents (with or without assigned subjects) used for training, evaluation, or testing. See [[Document corpus formats]].
